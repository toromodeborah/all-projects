                        Tigers may look like giant versions of our house cats but, unlike most domestic cats, they love water and
                        enjoy
                        swimming. They even hunt in water and can swim really far. Mum tigers give their cubs swimming lessons! So
                        no animal is
                        safe from a tiger… not even if it's in the water.
